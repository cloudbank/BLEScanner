Android BluetoothLeGatt Sample
===================================

This sample demonstrates how to use the Bluetooth LE 
to scan for devices.

Introduction
------------

This sample shows a list of available Bluetooth LE devices and provides
an interface to connect, display data and display GATT services and
characteristics supported by the devices.

It creates a [Service][1] for managing connection and data communication with a GATT server
hosted on a given Bluetooth LE device.

The Activities communicate with the Service, which in turn interacts with the [Bluetooth LE API][2].
